# Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree

This repository contains the solutions for the project works from the Udacity **AWS Cloud Architect** Nanodegree program. In this nanodegree, I learnt to:
- Use the highly available constructs within AWS to create highly available and resilient systems and networks. 
- Understand the connection between the technical aspects of these systems and their business operations and objectives.
- Understand best practices for failover and disaster management.
- Use AWS tools to identify and implement best practices for cost, and identify and understand the elements required to design and architect scalable infrastructure.
- Modify traditional infrastructure for performance, and identify architectures and workloads where serverless infrastructure should be considered to meet cost and performance goals.
- Deploy and destroy infrastructure from the terminal using the AWS CLI and Terraform.
- Best practices and strategies for securing access to cloud services and infrastructure in AWS to ensure data protection.
- Investigate security practices around monitoring and defending cloud based applications and environments.
