# Project 1 - Recoverability in AWS
In this project, I have created highly available solutions to common use cases. 

-  Built a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and showed how to use it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions.  
- Built a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.
