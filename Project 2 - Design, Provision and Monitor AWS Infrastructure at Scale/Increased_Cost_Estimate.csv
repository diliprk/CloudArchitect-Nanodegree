"AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services."

Changes, Larger (db.m5.4xlarge) RDS and (t3.xlarge) EC2 instances are deployed to handle increased data load and offer improved performance. Third availability zone setup in secondary region (ap-south-1) has its own VPC NAT Gateway, Cloudfront, ELB, Elastic IP, RDS Read Replica and EC2 AutoScaling.

Reasoning, Third AZ in the secondary region (ap-south-1) allows for failover if the primary region (us-east-1a) goes down in the event of a disaster. Larger RDS instances improve database performance and bigger EC2 instances improve application performance considering the overall growth of the platform over time.
