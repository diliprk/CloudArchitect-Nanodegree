"AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services."

Changes,Use smaller (t2.medium) EC2 and (db.m5.xlarge) RDS instances. Use Reserved instances booked for a year (without paying up front)

Reasoning,Smaller EC2 and RDS instances bring significant cost savings but would reduce performance. Reserved instances also reduce costs but locks the application to the selected infrastructure and limits rearchitecting of the application
